K Means Clustering

1.Start with K centroids by Putting them at random place ,For example K=2
2.Compute distance of every point from centroid and cluster them accordingly
3.Recompute the disctances and adjust the centroid until the clusters doesnt change 


SSE = Sum of Squared Errors

difference between each point from the clusters and summing it up
then plotting it in a graph (X_axis = k ,y_axis=SSE)
plot the elbow point
